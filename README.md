## 2. Installation Steps. 
### A. Ensure Required Files Are Available 
Follow 2A to download all files into your local machine. 

Open a Powershell terminal on your local machine. All commands provided are run in that terminal.

Make sure your current working directory is set to the folder where you want the files to be located with `cd your\directory`. Following that, clone the repository using the `git clone repo_link`. You should have all necessary files to run the app. 
```
cd /your/path/to/directory/dash_app
git clone git@github.com:dhcchh/Team-xgboosted---SMU-BIA-Datathon-2025.git
git clone https://github.com/dhcchh/Team-xgboosted---SMU-BIA-Datathon-2025 # if the previous command did not work

```

### B. Set Up the Environment 
1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (optional, but recommended). 
Itâ€™s good practice to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts. Enter the following commands in your machine's terminal. 
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```
2. Install Required Python Packages
Once inside the virtual environment, install dependencies:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Running the Dash App 
### A. Start the Local Server 
Run the following command: 
```
python app.py
```
or run the Python file in your IDE. 
If everything is set up correctly, you will see an output like: 
```
Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
```
This means that the application is running locally on port 8050 of your machine. No internet connectivity is required.  
### B. Open the App in Your Browser
1. Copy the local server URL from the terminal.
2. Open any web browser and paste the URL into the address bar.
